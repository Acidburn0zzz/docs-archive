| **Tools&nbsp;youâ€™ll&nbsp;need**       | A modern browser like Chrome. If using Chrome, download Chrome DevTools for Vue.js. An account in CodeSandbox.io. If you get lost, import the starting point for this chapter [here](https://github.com/VueVixens/projects/tree/master/chapter-1-end).

# Instructions
1. Start [here](https://github.com/VueVixens/projects/tree/master/chapter-2-end)
2. To perform API calls we will need a library called [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). It's a promise-based HTTP client that works both in the browser and in a node.js environment. We have to to add it to our project dependencies. To do so, please click on `File Editor` tab -> `Dependencies` -> `Add Dependency` and search for `axios`
3. Now let's import axios into the component where we will perform our API call - `Pets.vue`.
	```
	import axios from "axios";
	```
4. All our calls will use the same base URL with different endpoints. Let's add our base URL to axios' options:
	```
	axios.defaults.baseURL = "https://dog.ceo/api";
	```
	Now we are ready for our first API call.
5. Let's replace the first static image with the random husky picture from DogCEO API. First we have to check which endpoint should we use. Looking at the [documentation](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) we can easily find out that we need `/breed/husky/images/random` (`api` part is already in our base URL). We want new image to replace old one right on the component creation, so let's add a `created()` hook right after `data`:
	```
	created() {}
	```
6. Inside the created hook we will add our first query. To perform GET-request `axios` uses `axios.get` method. The result will be a JavaScript promise, so we have to provide success and failure callbacks to it. Let's simply print query result to console:
	```
    axios
      .get("/breed/husky/images/random")
      .then(response => {
        console.log(response);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.log(error);
      });
   ```
7. Now you can see an object in your console. We are interested in its `data` field. You can see we have a status `success` and a message with image URL (you can copy/paste it to your browser and have a look at a cute husky).
8. Let's replace our husky image with this new one. First, we should find a husky in our dogs array with an `Array.find` method. It will check array items one by one to find a first item matching provided criteria. In our case the criteria is a `breed` equal to `husky`. Add this string inside `then` callback:
	```
	const husky = this.dogs.find(dog => dog.breed === 'husky');
	```
9. Ok, we have found a husky, now let's provide a new nice portrait for it.
	```
	husky.img = response.data.message;
	```
